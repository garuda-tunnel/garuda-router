    Discriminator: an edge tunnel gw is a CGNAT 10.x P2P WireGuard address,

    None and take the directly-attached path; off-backbone gws are always

    never leaking into the directly-attached path.

    Why this is correct where the rolled-back direct-neighbor-Full gate failed:
    the edge owning the gw is TWO OSPF hops from the hub and is never a direct
    neighbor, so ``_router_neighbor_is_full(edge)`` is structurally always
    False. Here we instead check the hub-side leg (a real Full direct neighbor,
